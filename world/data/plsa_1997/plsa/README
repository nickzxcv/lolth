Public Land Survey System
=========================

The 'PLS' layer is a polygon coverage depicting the township, range 
and sections contained in the Public Land Survey System grid for the 
State of California. Townships are roughly six miles square, and are 
numbered north and south from an established baseline. Likewise, 
ranges are numbered east and west from an established meridian. 
California uses three baseline/meridians, these being Humboldt, Mt. 
Diablo, and San Bernardino, abbreviated HB&M, MDB&M, and SBB&M. 
Township and range values are combined in the redefined item 
TOWN-RANGE to facilitate dissolve and dropline functions.

TEALE Data Products
===================

Starting July 1, 2001 some of California's physical and cultural
geospatial information, formerly distributed by the Teale Data Center,
is being distributed to the public by the California Mapping
Coordinating Committee through servers at the California Environmental
Resources Evaluation System (CERES) in the Resources Agency and
National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Ames Research
Center.

There are no plans to actively maintain the currentness of these data
products.  In fact, updates to these data typically result in the
creation of new data products, and is not represented as changes to
these data.  These data should be considered a snapshot of data as
existed typically in the early and mid nineties.
