  COVERAGE NAME : PLSA

  COVERAGE DESCRIPTION: 
  
  The 'PLS' layer is a polygon coverage depicting the  
  township, range and sections contained in the Public Land  
  Survey System grid for the State of California. Townships  
  are roughly six miles square, and are numbered north and  
  south from an established baseline. Likewise, ranges are  
  numbered east and west from an established meridian.  
  California uses three baseline/meridians, these being   
  Humboldt, Mt. Diablo, and San Bernardino, abbreviated HB&M, 
  MDB&M, and SBB&M. Township and range values are combined in 
  the redefined item TOWN-RANGE to facilitate dissolve and  
  dropline functions.
  
  Many places in the State are not gridded into sections. Most 
  of these cases involve Spanish and Mexican landgrant areas  
  that were honored by the government of the United States  
  when California became a State, and were subsequently  
  excluded from the section survey process. Names of   
  landgrants may be found under the item LANDGRANT. Other  
  areas were not sectioned because of difficulties in   
  surveying wetlands and mountainous terrain. These areas are 
  identified in the item COMMENTS as 'wetlands' or 'not  
  sectioned'.
  
  The PLS layer can be of help in defining position and scale 
  on small-scale plots. It is of course irreplaceable if the  
  user is locating other features by means of    
  township/range/section identifiers. There is also a centroid 
  (point) coverage available that is not in the library. This 
  represents each section as a point and carries all the  
  township/range/section info as well as X and Y coordinates.

  DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT:
  
  The following are subjective comments regarding this data.
  
  The layer is as complete as the USGS 100K quad sheets. The 
  PLS coverage does not include 'projected' sections into  
  landgrant, wetland, or unsectioned areas. The feature  
  accuracy is good and attribute accuracy is very good. It 
  also has all pertinent section information.
